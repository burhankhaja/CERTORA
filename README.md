## About
- This repository is all about the certora.
- I compile notes, and tricks about certora here.

## ALPHA_TO_BE_EXPLORED
- **`Do certora official certora` [`contests`](https://www.certora.com/leaderboard#check-how-to-do-contests-here) `to strengthn spec writing game with monetary greed`**
- **`shadow audit aave all versions using certora and read official certora specs`**
  - After each version testing compeletion, read **certora official specs** to get pro level spec vision
  - **`REMEMBER AAVA IS CERTORA'S GIRLFRIEND, SO THEY MUST HAVE USED THEIR FULL_POWERS ðŸ˜„`**



## Un_Explored
- ghosts and hooks ? [;](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/cvl/ghosts.html)
- using `config files`, although not important but just for kick
- Built-in certora detectors
  - [Read-only-reentrancy-builtin-detecor](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/cvl/builtin.html#read-only-reentrancy-detection-viewreentrancy)
  - other built-in detectors like `overflows/underflows` and `sanity checks`
- [`GAMBIT: MUTANT GENERATOR`](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/gambit/index.html)
    - consider gambit a sort of **`automatic bug injection tool`**
    - why to use it? in order to verify specs
- [`EQUIVALENCE TESTING`](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/equiv-check/index.html)
  - You wanna test whether two different function implementations behave same?
  - **use equivalence**
