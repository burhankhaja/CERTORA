- `using` keyword
   - ```using Pool as underlying```
   - now you can access Pool.anyVariable in spec
- `--rule` to specify specific rule to run
  - cmd:```--rule OnlyBobsBalanceChanges```
  - so no matter how many rules spec has it will only run the above rule
- link using this flag to link a contract with an asset in main contract like
    - cmd:```--link erc20=dummyErc```
    - Now suppose main contract has `IERC20` variable, `erc20`
    - you create `dummyErc` and link it to the `erc20` variable in main contract
    - remember you will need this `dummyErc.sol` to add to scene while executing commands
- using `currentContract` returns address of main contract
   - example:```DummyErc.balanceOf(currentContract)```
- Order of spec writing
   - ```import statements > using statements > method block > rules```
